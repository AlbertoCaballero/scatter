# Scatter 0.0.2

This project is intended to fill the gap betwen data science tools and general use office-like applications. Scatter offers a simple interface that allows you to create, manage and process dataset with out the insanity of learning how to and using data science apps like Jupyter, or the inflexibility and cluncynes of programs like excel.

## Platforms used

It's based on angular architecture, all the logic and main funtionality is developed using this principles so we get the same features in a web app as we do in a desktop app.

## Running the development app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This is for the angular web app.

Run `npm run electron-build` to compile and run the electron desktop aplication. Or only `npm run electron` to execute the last compiled version of the app.

# Disclaimer

This is a really early prototype, its full of errors and it doesn have any of the most important functionality.
